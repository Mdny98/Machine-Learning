# Machine-Learning

This Machine Learning project is aimed at accurately classifying Iranian Traditional and Global music instruments, which are categorized into 6 types: Ney, Piano, Santour, Setar, Tar, and Violon. To achieve this goal, the project utilizes two primary Machine Learning techniques - classification and clustering.

To build the dataset, the project employs frequency sampling, analyzing over 1400 music files, resulting in a dataset of 5.5+ GB in size. The project consists of the following main steps: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, followed by classification and clustering methods.

In terms of classification, several Machine Learning algorithms have been implemented, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These algorithms are utilized to accurately classify the different types of musical instruments present in the dataset.

Moreover, for the clustering phase, the project uses two common methods: K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. These methods enable the project to identify patterns in the dataset and group similar instruments into distinct clusters.

Overall, this project is an exciting and challenging Machine Learning endeavor that will contribute to our understanding of how Machine Learning can be applied to the domain of music classification. The project holds a lot of potential for improving the accuracy of identifying Iranian Traditional and Global music instruments, and it can pave the way for further research in this area.
